# Opening (1 min)
- Check-in: How is everybody doing? Did everybody manage to do 100 lines, 3 commits and a merge request last week? How is the progress with the Code of Conduct? (5 min)
Everyone is doing fine. The code of conduct currently is at ~2000 words. We still need some words so we need to go into more detail and incorporate the tasks from the slides. 

# Approval of the agenda (2 min)
Everybody read the agenda and agrees with it.

- Approval of last minutes (2 min)
Everybody read the last minutes notes and understood them. We approve of Tom as a good minute taker.

- Did everybody read the TA notes (2 min)
Everybody read the TA notes and understood them.

# Points of action

 - How do we plan on finishing the Code of Conduct? (5 min)
Tim suggests finishing it on Thursday but Tom suggests finishing it before then so that we can review it and agree on the final draft. We decided that Tim Horia and Tautvydas will finish it before Thursday and we will review it on Thursday. Ilia suggests standartizing the COC so that it seems more formal.

 - We didn't finish the front end last week, should we work on it this week? (5 min)
Horia already started doing the front-end mock design. We agreed to try and do the controllers and front-end until Thursday and later distribute tasks further based on the lines of codes we have.  
	
    - Task distribution (3 min)
Artur takes on the user-flow before Thursday.
Tom suggests revising our code so that it fits with our logical schema that we drew on Thursday.
Everyone also focuses on the fron-end.

	- What should we code this week for the 100 lines  (2 min)
Discussed on the part of Code of Conduct and milestones. Also doing the controllers should be started.

- GitLab using Issues and Milestones (5 min)
We agreed we should incorporate Milestones and Issues in our workflow.

- Making the milestones for the next week (3 min)
Ilia makes milestone: "Reach 2500 words for the Code of Conduct" deadline: Thursday. Work assigned to Horia Tim and Tautvydas.
Horia makes milestone: "User Flow", deadline: Thursday. Artur takes it on.
Horia makes milestone: "Front-End", deadline: Friday. It is assigned to everybody

- Any suggestions on how we can improve our workflow? (3 min)
Ilia says that our work during the meetings is of good quality and says that our plan changed a bit during the week but that is quite natural due to the early state of the project.
Tom suggests making our commits and merges more complete and not fragmented. Also suggests making the titles and description more descriptive. Tom says that commits should be more strict and we should merge less but of more quality. This would naturally lead to more commits during a merge. Ilia suggests commiting more and merging less. We decided that a minimum of 2 people should approve before merging. 

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*

# Any other business (2 min)
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*
We discussed the punishments for being absent during a meeting. We agreed that the idea of bringing a cake would not be that efficient. We agreed that it would be better if we see that being absent is constant and without justification we should bring a TA to discuss it.

# Questions for the TA (3 min) 
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*
Horia asks of some resources that would help with the development.
Kasper says that googling is the best resource and going along during the development. Also JavaFX documentation is quite useful.

Tom asks where to submit the code of conduct.
Kasper says that it is on Brightspace, deadline: Friday.

Tautvydas asks how to count the lines of code.
Kasper says that using git inspect is a way, but there is no way of knowing the exact script the course evaluators use.

# Question round (3 min)
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

No questions between the group

# Closing (1 min)
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
Discussing the assingments of the next meeting: Tim wants to be the chair and Horia wants to be the minute taker.
