Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Chosen beforehand and different people took different roles!

#### Agenda 
_Good_

It was added in time, follows the template and the main talking points were clear. I suggest focussing "What will we be working on this week?" more on which concrete features you will implement, and spend a bit more time on how the tasks will be distrubuted and who will do what (action points). Also missing the "announcements from TA" point.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Good_

They were clear and merged into the agenda. I am missing the action points for the next week, really make sure that is concretely written down in the minutes.


#### Chair performance
_Excellent_

It's clear that you took the lead and made sure all agenda topics were covered. Could ask for some people's opinions if they are a little quieter.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Very good_

Constructive meeting, everyone was listening and paying attention well! Everyone took responsiblity really well!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Sufficient_

You showed the me the current state with the frontend screens working and some controller classes with a couple endpoints. However you really should start working on the client/server communication ASAP to be on track!


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_sufficient_

It was shortly talked about the action points of the previous week, however not in detail. If the minute taker notes down clear action points, you can look those minutes during the meeting point: "Reflect on last week's work". You divide the issues and milestones after each meeting, but you could also do that during the meeting, by saying we should work on feature X this week, and person Y and Z will work on this.
