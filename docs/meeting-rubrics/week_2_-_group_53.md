#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Good that there is a chair and minute taker chosen beforehand!

#### Agenda 
_Sufficient_

There were good points added to the agenda! I gave "Sufficient" here, as the old template was used, not the new one. Make sure for next week to copy the correct template.

Also make sure to dicuss the action points of the previous week (if they were completed/what was difficult etc)


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_not applicable_


#### Chair performance
_Sufficient_

It was nice that the chair let everybody speak! However the conversations were not always structered or led by the chair. It is the responsbility of the chair to make sure the discussions keep going and stay on track, and not of the participants. 


#### Attitude & Relation
_Very Good_

Everybody was friendly and constructive! The team took good ownership. Not everybody was equally participating during discussions, which could be worked on.


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Sufficient_

You showed the current state of the application, which still was the demo project. Because there were no changes yet, I can't give feedback on this point yet. I only gave "sufficient" here as you did not add anything to the demo.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Good_

I think you will be well on track to equally divide tasks and features. Next week, when discussing if/what the action points of the previous week are completed, I will be able to give more feedback!
