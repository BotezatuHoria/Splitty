Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Different and chosen beforehand! Just not correctly in the agenda.

#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

Looks really good! Good time estimation, follows the template and clear individual points. Keep it up like this. Try to have the right minute-taker/chair noted down beforehand.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Very Good_

Merged into the agena and a good amount of clear notes. Some notes could be clearer: "We might meet on Wednesday." can be expanded to say the criteria for the decision of when to meet, otherwise very good!

#### Chair performance
_Excellent_

All topics were clearly covered for an appropiate amount and made sure the meaning was productive! Really good that you made sure a conclusion/summary was made after discussing the work distribution.

#### Attitude & Relation
_Excellent_

Good feedback round at the end of the meeting! Everyone was constructive and friendly, keep it up!


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Good_

Some progress compared to last week, like server switching, popups, editing, settling debts, etc. Still need to finish the basic requirements like websockets, json dumps and some admin page bugs. Try to finish those this week to ensure a well working final application.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Very good_

Talked about all the action points of the previous week and it seems most tasks are well divided between group members. I really liked where everyone talked about their perceived workload, keep that up!
