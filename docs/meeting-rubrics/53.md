#### 1) Self-organization
_Good_

The team was in charge and it felt like a good meeting later on. everybody was honest with their goals and gave their opinions, which was nice to see! Sometimes the discussions were not in the whole group (e.g on your phone), try to balance that!


#### 2) Suggested Topics
_Good_

There were good discussions about goals and teamwork. The meeting could have been better moderated/structered, next week having an agenda will help (read the teamwork document on Brightspace!). The project Splitty was not discussed and each other's coding experiences with e.g. REST was not discussed.
