Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Chosen beforehand and different people!

#### Agenda 
_Good_

It was added on time and individual points were clear. I am missing the anouncements by the TA, the sprint retrospective and sprint planning.  
For the retrospective: shift point 4 (Reflect on the work of the past 2 weeks) into a sprint retrospective. Look at all the action points that are in the minutes of the previous meeting. Discuss for each action point if it was completed or not.  
For the sprint planning: shift point 6 (How will we distribute this weeks work?) into "sprint planning". Here you will divide tasks: e.g. person x will implement the admin page login by date y. The "summarize action points" section will summarize all the divided tasks, and the minute taker will clearly write the "Who , what , when?"


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Good_

Good job! Clear and thourough without unneeded information. To improve work on the "summarize action points: Who , what , when? (5 min)" Here you don't mention the who/when.

#### Chair performance
_Very Good_

Led the discussions and made sure all points were covered & gave everyone the chance to give input. Try to keep the meeting together until the end.

#### Attitude & Relation
_Very Good_

Good meeting, where It fell out at the end of the meeting when the demo was showed, so try to keep it together until the official end.


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Sufficient_

You show the application, you can create events and expenses (with dates/amount/catergory), which are propegated to the server. The client does not retrieve information yet, make sure to work on that ASAP. You are behind on other groups, however still on track to deliver a working application at the project end.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Insufficient_

Did not discuss the action list of the previous week. This should be done in the sprint retrospective. Here you should look at the minutes of the previous meeting, go over all the action points and see if they were completed or not. All group members are contributing, some more/less than others, so try to balance it out if you feel this holds for you.
