    Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Different and chosen beforehand!

#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

Very good, keep it up! Has the needed points and good main talking/discussion points on the state of the current application!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Very good_

Merged into the agenda and good amount. Put the "work distribution" under "Summarize action points: Who , what , when?" and add a deadline for all of the points, other than that, keep it up like this!


#### Chair performance
_Excellent_

Great job, covered everything in a timely manner!


#### Attitude & Relation
_Really good_

Meetings have really been improving over the past weeks and are going really well! Make sure to take initiative during discussions even if you are not asked anything!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Good_

Good progress from last week, looks really good now. Password generation, language selection, admin page, create events & participant, etc! Still need to finish some of the last features like syncing everything up or settling debts! Keep on it these last weeks to make sure you have a well working application at the end.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Very good_

Went over the action list of the previous week, what went well/didn't etc! Also divided tasks really well which was very good. Work distribution between group members look good, and that is also a part of the meeting, if you notice something you can say if someone should contribute less/more or issues.
