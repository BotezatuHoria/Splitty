Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

There were different chair/minute taker and chosen beforehand!

#### Agenda 
_Very good_

The agenda was added to the repo on time and follows the (old) template, but that is fine! The points are very clear and everyone knows what is expected. "We didn't finish the front end last week, should we work on it this week?" is clear enough so that everyone can prepare. However missing the point where there is a demo given to the TA. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Good_

THe notes were merged into the agenda and there is a good amount of them! It is very clear when you note down each group member's name following by what they said (like everyone's coding experiences). The notes don't contain clear agreements/a summary of the Action points for the following week. Make sure the Minute Taker does this in their minutes. Like in the template: "Sumamrize action points:: Who, What, Where".


#### Chair performance
_Good_

The chair made sure all topics were covered, but could have been better in time management. Some discussions went astray from the agenda which should be avoided. A taks of the chair is to make sure after each talking point, there is a conclusion reached.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Sufficient_

There were good discussions about the frontend, merge request titles and about how the previous meeting went. However the overall meeting was not always equally active, as some people where on their phone or not participiating in discussions. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Sufficient_

You presented the current application, which consisted of common classes, which looked well thought out, and some frontend scenes. However make sure to work on the backend at the same time too! It would be nice to see a runnable application next meeting with some client/server communication.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Sufficient_

There was not a clear discussion about the action points of the previous week, it would be nice to see that next meeting (who completed their tasks or why not). Also then divide action points for the coming week, where you clearly mention who will do what part.
